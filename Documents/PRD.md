# Overview

We're Safe is a technical solution that aims to bring security to women everywhere. It is a comprehensive application that can help women who feel insecure in the street, as well as women who are victims of domestic violence. The application will be available for multiple devices, making it easily accessible and widely available.

# Opportunity Statement

The problem that software designed to protect women from violence and abuse is trying to solve is the alarming rate of violence against women globally. According to the World Health Organization, about 1 in 3 women worldwide have experienced physical or sexual violence at some point in their lives. This violence can take many forms, including domestic violence, sexual assault, harassment, and sex trafficking. It is a pervasive and persistent problem that affects women of all ages, races, and socioeconomic backgrounds.


The impact of violence against women is far-reaching, both for the individual women affected and for society as a whole. It can result in physical injuries, mental health issues, and even death. It also has a profound effect on women's ability to participate fully in society, including their access to education, employment, and other opportunities.


Given the magnitude and complexity of the problem, there is a critical need for innovative solutions to address it. Software designed to protect women from violence and abuse can be an important tool in this effort, as it can help women to access resources, connect with support networks, and take steps to enhance their safety. It can also raise awareness about the problem and contribute to changing societal attitudes towards violence against women.

# Audience

The lives of women who are at risk of experiencing violence or who have already experienced it will be the most directly impacted by this project. 

They will have access to a tool that can help them feel more empowered and in control of their safety, potentially saving lives and providing critical assistance in dangerous situations.

 The project can also contribute to building a safer and more just society for everyone by raising awareness about the issue of violence against women and promoting attitudes of respect and equality.

# What will happen

Today, violence against women remains a widespread problem, with women experiencing various forms of violence and abuse in both public and private spheres. Despite many efforts to address the issue, progress has been slow, and there is still work to be done.

We can hope for a world where violence against women is no longer accepted or tolerated tomorrow. 
A world where women can live their lives without the fear of violence or abuse, where their rights and safety are respected, and where they are empowered to take control of their own lives. 

Software designed to protect women from violence and abuse can contribute to making this vision a reality by providing access to resources, support networks, and safety tools, as well as raising awareness about the issue and promoting attitudes of respect and equality. With the right resources, commitment, and action, we can work towards a better future for women and a safer and more just society for all.


# Success criteria

Multiple metrics can evaluate the effectiveness of the software and make adjustments to ensure that it is meeting its intended goals and having the desired impact.

- **User engagement**: The number of women who use the software, how frequently they use it, and for how long. A high level of engagement indicates that the software is meeting a real need and providing value to its users.

- **User satisfaction**:The feedback from users about the software's functionality, ease of use, and effectiveness in helping them feel safer and more empowered.

- **Impact on safety**: The software's ability to help women avoid or respond to dangerous situations, as well as data on how many women have been able to do so successfully.

- **Awareness and advocacy**:The impact of the software on raising awareness about violence against women, promoting attitudes of respect and equality, and encouraging more people to take action to end violence against women.

- **Reduction of violence**: Ultimately, the success of the project can be measured by the extent to which it contributes to reducing incidents of violence against women, and by the positive impact it has on women's lives.

# Sizing

A minimal viable product[^mvp] could be achievable within a year and half. 

# Selected solution

To develop an MVP[^mvp], the principal features that are needed are:

- **Personal safety features**: The software could include a panic button that can notify emergency contacts or law enforcement.

- **Location-based services**: The software could use GPS or other location-based technologies to help users find safe routes, locate safe places to stay or connect with emergency services in their area.

- **Save evidence**: The software could include a database where users can save documents, photos, videos or voice records that can be considered as evidence for complaint. 

Once the principal features are done, in an effective way, it will be easier to integrate the others.
We can consider these features out-of-scope because I'm not considering these as the foundation of the software.

- **Physical security devices**: The software might not include physical security devices such as alarms or cameras, instead focusing on mobile software solutions.

- **Legal advice**: The software will not include legal advice depending on the situation of the user.
**Behavioural change: The software might not include features aimed at changing the behaviour of potential aggressors, instead focusing on helping users protect themselves and seek assistance when necessary.

- **Community building**: The software could include features that allow users to connect with other users in their area, build networks of support, and share information about resources and services that could be helpful.

- **Educational resources**: The software could include educational resources that help users understand their rights, recognize warning signs, and learn ways to protect themselves from violence.

# Constraints

The main constraints of this project are:

- **Technical constraints**: The software would have to be developed within certain technical constraints, such as the capabilities of the programming language, the platforms it is designed to run on, and the processing power of the devices it will be used on.

- **Data limitations**: The accuracy and effectiveness of the software may be limited by the quality and availability of data on violence against women and other relevant statistics.

- **User limitations**: The software may be limited by the technical abilities and internet access of its intended user base, as well as by the geographic and cultural factors that may influence their willingness to use the software.

- **Legal and ethical considerations**: The project would need to be developed in accordance with relevant legal and ethical considerations. For instance, it may be necessary to consider issues such as data privacy, security, and ownership.

- **Resource constraints**: The project would be limited by the resources available for its development, including time, money, and expertise.

- **Cultural and linguistic limitations**: The software would need to be designed to be culturally and linguistically appropriate to its intended users. This would include considerations such as language translation and appropriate imagery.

- **Accessibility considerations**: The software would need to be designed to be accessible to users with disabilities, such as those who are visually or hearing impaired.

# Milestones

The project work should start on the 1st of April, 2022, once the project is accepted. The first version of the software needs to be pushed into the beta testing phase[^beta] by January 2024. 

However, here are the main milestones[^milestone]:

- **Project planning and scoping**: This milestone would involve defining the project's goals, objectives, and requirements, as well as determining the resources and timelines for its development.
