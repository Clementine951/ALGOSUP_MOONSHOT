# Context

This project aims to create a software application that empowers women to take control of their safety and quickly access help if they feel threatened or unsafe. 

The problem addressed is that many women face the risk of violence or harassment in public spaces or their homes. Existing solutions have limitations, such as high costs, lack of accessibility or limited reach, and do not always provide reliable and rapid assistance.

# Goal

The goal of this project is to provide a user-friendly, affordable, fast, and widely accessible software application that enables women to feel more secure and confident in their daily lives. 

The software application will leverage the latest advances in technology, including mobile devices, location-based services, and cloud computing, to deliver a reliable and effective solution that meets the needs of the users.

# Stakeholders

The stakeholders of this project could include:

- Women who will use the application to protect themselves and seek help.

- Sponsors who will provide funding and resources for the project to be developed and sustained over time.

- Law enforcement agencies and emergency services that may be involved in providing support to women in distress through the application.

- Women's rights organizations and advocacy groups that may be interested in promoting the use of the application and ensuring that it aligns with their goals and values.

- Regulatory bodies or government agencies that may have a role in overseeing the development and use of the application to ensure that it complies with laws and regulations.

- Friends and family members of women who may use the application, as they may be involved in providing support and assistance in cases of emergency.

- Media outlets or journalists who may report on the application and its impact on society.

- As this project is part of my studies, ALGOSUP [^algosup] will have a role in checking the work done.

# Target

The target audience for this project is women of all ages, backgrounds, and locations who want to feel more secure and protected in their daily lives. The software application will be designed to be easy to use, intuitive, and customizable to fit the preferences and needs of each user. The application will also take into account the specific risks and challenges faced by women in different contexts and provide relevant guidance and support.

# Scenarios

## Aly scenario

Aly is an outgoing high school student who enjoys socializing and attending events with her friends. However, her parents are always worried about her safety, so they have imposed a strict curfew at midnight. Aly understands their concern but sometimes feels frustrated and limited by their rules.

One day, Aly's friend recommends that she download the We're Safe app to help ease her parents' worries and allow her to stay out a little later. Aly is hesitant at first but decides to give it a try.

With We're Safe, Aly can use the "Safe Places" feature to find well-lit and secure areas where she can hang out with her friends. She is also able to set a "Companion" timer, which notifies her designated contacts if she doesn't check in after a certain amount of time.
Aly's parents are initially sceptical of the app, but they become more comfortable with her going out when she shows them the features and how it can help keep her safe. They are particularly reassured by the "Companion" timer, which provides an extra level of security and peace of mind for them.

Over time, Aly becomes more comfortable using We're Safe and begins to explore her city more confidently, knowing that she has a reliable tool to help her stay safe. She's grateful for her friend's recommendation and the increased trust and independence that the app has provided.

## Anna scenario

Anna uses We're Safe on her phone to check the route for her daily commute to the university. She's happy to see that the app has a map that indicates the streets that are well-lit and safe places to walk. As she reviews the route, she notices that one part of her commute is not well-lit, and the app shows that there are no safe places nearby.

Anna is concerned about this and decides to report the issue through the app. She quickly finds the "Report an Issue" feature and describes the problem. She also includes a photo of the poorly lit area so that the We're Safe team can investigate further.

The next day, Anna receives a notification from We're Safe indicating that they have investigated the area and have added additional lighting. Anna is relieved to hear this news and feels much safer on her daily commute. She also appreciates the quick response from We're Safe and decides to use the app to report any safety issues in her neighbourhood from now on.

## Brianna scenario

Brianna is a freelance Wordpress developer who frequently travels to meet clients in unfamiliar parts of town. She always carries her phone with her to stay connected with her clients and colleagues. However, Brianna often feels uneasy and unsafe while traveling alone, especially in new or unfamiliar areas.

One day, while walking to a meeting with a new client in an unfamiliar part of Grosseto, Brianna decides to try We're Safe. She opens the app and inputs her destination, and We're Safe generates a route for her, highlighting the safest streets and areas to avoid. The app also provides her with real-time updates on any safety concerns or incidents in the area.

As Brianna walks, she feels more secure and confident, knowing that she's using a tool that can help her stay safe. She notices that the app alerts her to an upcoming area that has a history of theft and vandalism, and she quickly decides to take a detour to avoid that area.

Thanks to We're Safe, Brianna arrives safely to her meeting with her new client, feeling more secure and empowered. She decides to continue using the app to help her navigate unfamiliar areas, and even recommends it to her other freelancer friends who travel frequently for work.

## Colby scenario

Colby is worried about his friend Olivia who is in an abusive relationship. He downloads the "We're Safe" application and sets up a personal profile. He also sets up his friend's emergency contacts, which include her family and the campus police department. 

Colby encourages his friend to download the app as well, but she is hesitant. Colby explains to her how the app works, and how it can help her feel safer and more secure in her daily life. With her permission, Colby sets up a "safety buddy" feature with her on the app, which allows him to receive alerts whenever she feels unsafe or needs help. 

Colby can then take appropriate action to ensure his friend's safety, whether that means checking in on her or calling for emergency assistance. With the "We're Safe" app, Colby feels more confident in his ability to help his friend and keep her safe from harm.

## Courntey scenario

Courtney is a nurse who has been dealing with the stress of a recent break-up and the ongoing harassment from her ex-partner. She has been feeling anxious and scared for her safety, especially when travelling to and from work. She is looking for a solution that can help her feel more secure and in control of her life.

One day, a colleague suggests to Courtney that she try We're Safe, a personal safety app that can help her track her location, contact emergency services, and alert her emergency contacts if she feels unsafe. Intrigued by the idea, Courtney downloads the app and sets up her profile.

The first time Courtney uses We're Safe, she is walking home from work late at night and notices someone following her. She feels a sense of panic but remembers the app on her phone. She opens it and clicks on the "Alert Emergency Contacts" button. The app immediately sends a message to her chosen contacts, alerting them to her location and that she needs help. One of her friends calls her back within seconds, and Courtney feels much calmer knowing that someone is aware of her situation.

Over the next few days, Courtney starts using We're Safe regularly. She feels more confident knowing that she can contact her emergency contacts and the authorities if she needs to. The app's feature for saving evidence also helps her gather information on her ex-partner's harassment and feel more secure about taking legal action against him. With the help of We're Safe, Courtney feels more in control of her life and confident that she can escape the fear caused by her ex-partner's harassment.

## Katy scenario

Katy is a 30-year-old refugee who recently moved to a new country and is unfamiliar with the local area. She is feeling anxious and uncertain about her safety when travelling alone, especially at night. She has heard about We're Safe and is curious to see how it can help her feel more secure.

One evening, Katy is walking home from the bus stop after work. She notices that a man is following her and she starts to feel scared. She takes out her phone and opens We're Safe. Using the app's "Emergency" feature, Katy is able to quickly send an alert to her emergency contacts and the local authorities. She also uses the app's "Find a Safe Place" feature to locate a nearby well-lit area with other people around. As she waits for help to arrive, Katy feels calmer and in control, knowing that she has taken steps to protect herself.

After the incident, Katy decides to explore the other features of We're Safe to help her feel more prepared and knowledgeable about her legal rights and available support services. She uses the app's "Resources" feature to find information about local support organizations that can help her if she ever needs it. She also uses the "Safety Tips" feature to learn about ways to prevent and respond to harassment and assault.

With the help of We're Safe, Katy feels more confident and empowered to navigate her new environment and take control of her safety.

## Kayla scenario

Kayla downloads the We're Safe application after learning about it from a friend. She is nervous about using it on her phone because her abusive husband monitors her phone usage, but she decides to use a friend's phone to create an account and log in.

After getting familiar with the application, Kayla realizes that she can use it to save evidence of the abuse she has suffered from her husband. She takes pictures of her injuries and records the times and dates of each incident. She also documents any threatening messages or phone calls from her husband.

Kayla contacts a local domestic violence support organization through the We're Safe app and schedules an appointment to meet with a counsellor. She shares the evidence she has collected with the counsellor, who explains her options for getting a restraining order and finding a safe place to stay.

With the support of the counsellor, Kayla takes legal action against her husband and is granted a restraining order. The evidence she collected through the We're Safe app is critical in the legal proceedings. Kayla is able to escape from her husband and is provided with temporary housing and support from the domestic violence organization.

Through the We're Safe app, Kayla is able to continue documenting any contact or threats from her husband, which strengthens her case in court. She is finally able to move on and begin a new life for herself and her children, free from abuse and fear.

## Zaynab scenario

Zaynab has been worried about her friend Rima, who is in an abusive relationship with her partner. Zaynab has been trying to find ways to help Rima but is unsure of what to do. One day, while searching online for resources, Zaynab comes across We're Safe, an app that helps people dealing with domestic violence.

Zaynab downloads the app and creates an account. She is able to access a variety of resources and information on how to help someone who is experiencing domestic violence. She shares this information with Rima and encourages her to seek help.
Zaynab also uses the app to document the incidents of abuse that Rima has shared with her. She takes pictures of Rima's injuries and saves them in the app. Zaynab also records the dates and times of the incidents and any other details that might be useful in building a case against Rima's abuser.

With the help of We're Safe, Zaynab is able to connect Rima with local resources for survivors of domestic violence. She uses the app to find and contact a local domestic violence hotline, which provides Rima with additional support and guidance on how to leave her abuser.

Over time, Rima is able to gather more evidence against her abuser and build a strong case against him. With Zaynab's help and the resources provided by We're Safe, Rima is eventually able to leave her abuser and start a new life free from violence.
