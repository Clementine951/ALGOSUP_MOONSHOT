1. WHAT problem is your moonshot project solving

The problem I will try to solve is the lack of security for women.
I choose this subject because is important to me.

Like everyone else, I have already been a victim or known someone who has been a victim of aggression, violence, or insecurity. And as a woman, as a citizen, I want and I need to end this. We need to put a stop to this.

“I know it sounds crazy to think that I could change something, but that’s what the MoonShot project is all about. Even if I can help just one person, I would be proud”

2. WHY do you think this problem is worth solving

To put it into context, all the figures I’m going to give you, are a low estimation because a lot of women don’t talk about what they have been through.

213 000 women have been victims of physical, verbal, moral, or sexual assault in 2021.

As you can see on these charts, 55% of these women didn’t take any initiative with health professionals, like doctors, and psychologists. And even worse, 73% didn’t report it to the police.

I believe many women don’t file any complaints against their aggressors because they know it will go nowhere. They know that it will be a waste of time and in the process, their health will be affected.

3. HOW are you going to solve that problem (brief technical explanation of the technologies used).

My solution is to develop an application.

The first version : 

- send your localization
- call or message (contact/emergency service/person nearby who has the app ) with the possibility of choosing in advance or at the moment.
- save emergency contact
- the possibility of triggering a powerful alarm to deter an attacker (maybe not loud enough)
- compatible with smartwatches
- choose if constant location sharing
- free
- use without internet
- use it without a network?

And to go further :

Allows victims of aggression to record what happened afterward, up to x minutes after the event.

Activation of a stream visible to authorities or emergency contacts, to find out what is going on.
The streams would be recorded to allow complaints to be filed

The challenge of this application is to make it user-friendly, discreet, and fast. 

For the technological side, it will be a challenge for this application to make it usable without the internet or network and make it very fast. And also the security of the datas.
