1. WHAT problem is your moonshot project solving

The problem I will try to solve is the lack of security for women.
I choose this subject because is important to me.

Like everyone else, I have already been a victim or known someone who has been a victim of aggression, violence, or insecurity. And as a woman, as a citizen, I want and I need to end this. We need to put a stop to this.

“I know it sounds crazy to think that I could change something, but that’s what the MoonShot project is all about. Even if I can help just one person, I would be proud”

2. WHY do you think this problem is worth solving

To put it into context, all the figures I’m going to give you, are a low estimation because a lot of women don’t talk about what they have been through.

213 000 women have been victims of physical, verbal, moral, or sexual assault in 2021.

As you can see on these charts, 55% of these women didn’t take any initiative with health professionals, like doctors, and psychologists. And even worse, 73% didn’t report it to the police.

I believe many women don’t file any complaints against their aggressors because they know it will go nowhere. They know that it will be a waste of time and in the process, their health will be affected.

3. HOW are you going to solve that problem (brief technical explanation of the technologies used).

The solution that I want to propose you is an application. With this application you can do two things: 

- Reported that you are in danger.
- See where are the most dangerous zones.

For the security of the application and the security of the users, they will need an account with a photo of their identity card. This is to protect the users from people who want to make fake emergency.

### Reported that you are in danger.

To report that you are in danger, it has to be quick and subtle. 

I was thinking about a button on the application that when you pressed twice, it sends your location to the people that have the application and are around you. You can also put an emergency contact and your location will be sent to them.

### See where are the most dangerous zones.

A heat map in real time will be available, all the most dangerous zone will be in red (according to the data). You will also can see all the emergency alert.

If the user doesn't have internet, he can send alert, but he won't be able to see all the other alert. 

In case of the user don't have network, a special number exist for this type of case.
